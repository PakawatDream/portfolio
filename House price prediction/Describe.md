House Price prediction 

Source: Kaggle 

It's my first project using regression to predict price. I am looking for more examples of how to do this and generate it in my style. I use logarithms to make the sale price distribution nearly the same as the normal distribution. I use more than one model and weight to calculate the price.

Describe: Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.
With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.
