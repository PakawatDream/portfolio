Retail: Retail Data Prediction

This project is in the Project Day of the Data Master course. They give 5 minutes to present.

Describe :The growth of supermarkets in most populated cities are increasing and market competitions are also high. The dataset is one of the historical sales of a supermarket company which has been recorded in 3 different branches for 3 months. Predictive data analytics methods are easy to apply with this dataset.

Solution:I separate the data into branches and preprocess it. I used deterministic and linear regression to forecast total income in the next quarter. I find branch C has the most decrease, so I focus on branch C. I did EDA to find insights for Branch C, give examples of action to impact the business, and present it in a slide show.
